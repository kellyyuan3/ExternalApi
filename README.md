# ExternalApi

A new Springboot project.

## Description

This project calls and processes an external api (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) using WebClient, a Springboot dependency that asynchronously processes HTTP requests. Through this project, I gained experience in HTTP requests and API calls, and developed new skills in Kotlin and Springboot!

## Required Downloads

- Springboot
- IntelliJ

## Steps to Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Intellij, and run the WorldpayApiApplication.kt file
3. Open Postman Desktop Agent
4. Test the WorldpayApiController methods by setting the HTTP method and entering the localhost url (eg. GET http://localhost:8080/ext/1)
